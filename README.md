After the code has been compiled, the user can start the game with the following command:

`./a.out <First Character name> <First Character Health> <First Character Damage> <Second Character name> <Second Character Health> <Second Character Damage>`

  Example: `./a.out Maple 150 10 Sally 45 30`
  
 After putting in the characters, the game starts. The first character hits the second character and then the second hits the first one, this continues until one of the characters die, after that the winner is announced.
  
  Example:
  ```
Maple -> Sally
Maple: HP: 30, DMG: 10
Sally: HP: 0, DMG: 30
Sally died. Maple wins.
```
